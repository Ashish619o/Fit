        <p>Being physically active can improve your brain health, 
        help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen
         bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday
          activities. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous
           physical activity gain some health benefits.</p>
